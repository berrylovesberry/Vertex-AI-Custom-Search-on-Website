# Vertex-AI-Custom-Search-on-Website

This project enables semantic search on website content using Google Cloud Vertex AI Custom Search, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system leverages Vertex AI to crawl and index content from specific websites defined in a custom data store. It retrieves the top 10 most relevant webpages and returns each pageâ€™s title, URL, and a content snippet, providing customized and grounded search results to the user.
